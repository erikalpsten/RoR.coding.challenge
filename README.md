Ruby On Rails - Coding Challenge June 2017
---
## The Challenge
---
First, create a new github repo, named using a GUID generator.
Next, create a new ruby on rails project satisfying the following requirements: 
* The web application manages the asset database for a customer in an insurance company. The customer has an arbitrary number of assets.
* The customer has the fields: name (string), DOB (datetime), customerID (integer), country (string)
* Each asset has the fields: name (string), insurer (string), premium (decimal), assetID (integer), createdDate (datetime), renewalDate (datetime)
* The web application's main page should display the customer information as well as a table with the assets
* On the main page, the user should be able to add new assets by filling in appropriate information. This new asset should be stored in the database. The User should not be able to add 2 assets with the same assetID, i.e. this should be a unique field.
* By clicking on an asset label, a new tab is opened showing all product details. Here, the user should have the option to delete the asset from the database
* The web application should be monitored through a web browser using a simple graphical interface 
* Assets created in one session should be stored in the database so that they are displayed properly in a future session

Once finished, upload project to the created github repo
